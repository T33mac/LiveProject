# Mount Rainier Project

This project involved searching climbing data from Mount Raineer to find correlations in the data.
In the Climb_Success_Summer file, the date needed to be converted to and integer to be properly scaled.
I then created a regression model for two recent years to predict the best time period to succeed in 
climbing a particular trail during a three month period. I found that dot plots with regression lines 
best represented this data.

In the Most_Used_Route file, I created a dataframe of the top ten trails re-indexed in descending order 
of the most travelled trails. I chose to do this because there were so many different trails and some 
had such little climbing data. A simple bar chart best represented this data.
