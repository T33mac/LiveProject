# Google Play Store

This project was to search app data from the googleplaystore.csv file. I created different visuals in things like 
app category popularity by installs and installs by content ratings. Without a good time series to work with and 
a lot of the data being categorical, the best visuals seemed to be bar charts throughout this project.
